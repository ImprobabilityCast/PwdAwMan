# PwdAwMan

Here there be creepers and encrypted passwords. At this point, this program can:

* Read and decrypt a file full of passwords and things
* Encrypt that same file with a password
* Modify/add passwords and things
* Copy a specified password or other thing to the clipboard

## Building
Nothing fancy. Run `make PwdAwMan.jar`. Note that this project uses [jasypt-1.9.3](https://github.com/jasypt/jasypt).
Other versions may work as well. The Makefile should work if the
Jasypt jar file is in the same directory as the Makefile.
